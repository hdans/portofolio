    description: `Teaching young minds at TK Al Jariyah Ciseke about responsible waste management using the 3R approach. 

In the heart of Ciseke Street, a bustling community near Universitas Padjadjaran, we noticed a commendable effort in keeping the area clean. Yet, there was a need for a deeper understanding, especially among the little ones. Inspired by Indonesia Emas 2045 vision, we decided to take action.

Our journey involved introducing waste concepts through playful learning and sparking creativity through hands-on activities. From themed exercises to crafting with recyclables, we aimed to make waste management engaging for these young learners.

As the Project Officer, it was immensely rewarding to witness the enthusiasm and curiosity of the children as they explored the world of waste in a fun and educational way. Here's to fostering a sense of environmental responsibility and creativity in the leaders of tomorrow!
